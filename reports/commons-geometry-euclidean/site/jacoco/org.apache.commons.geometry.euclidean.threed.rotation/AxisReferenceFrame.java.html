    /** Defines a relative reference frame for a rotation sequence. Sequences
     * with this type of reference frame are called &lt;em&gt;intrinsic rotations&lt;/em&gt;.
     *
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * When using a relative reference frame, each successive axis
     * is located relative to the &quot;thing&quot; being rotated and not to some
     * external frame of reference. For example, say that a rotation sequence
     * is defined around the {@code x}, {@code y}, and {@code z} axes in
     * that order. The first rotation will occur around the standard {@code x}
     * axis. The second rotation, however, will occur around the {@code y}
     * axis after it has been rotated by the first rotation; we can call this
     * new axis {@code y'}. Similarly, the third rotation will occur around
     * {@code z''}, which may or may not match the original {@code z} axis.
     * A good real-world example of this type of situation is an airplane,
     * where a pilot makes a sequence of rotations in order, with each rotation
     * using the airplane's own up/down, left/right, back/forward directions
     * as the frame of reference.
     * &lt;/p&gt;

     * In contrast with the relative reference frame, the absolute reference frame
     * remains fixed throughout a rotation sequence, with each rotation axis not
     * affected by the rotations.
